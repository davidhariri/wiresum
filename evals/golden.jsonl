It was small but incredibly talented and led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-d-b265a12/\">Jon Delman</a>, a master of this craft. And yes, Jon and team designed icons for Apple.</p>\n<p>Those glory days are long gone and the icons coming out of Cupertino these days are pedestrian, to put it gently. The best observation about Apple's icon decline comes from <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@heliographe.studio/post/DTeOwAykwQ1\">H\u00e9liographe</a>, via <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/macos_26_tahoes_dead_canary_utility_app_icons\">John Gruber</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you put the Apple icons in reverse it looks like the portfolio of someone getting really really good at icon design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://rogerwong.b-cdn.net/media/tahoe-icons-reverse-portfolio.jpg\" alt=\"Row of seven pen-and-paper app icons showing design evolution from orange stylized pen to ink bottle with fountain pen.\"></p>\n<p><em>Posted by @heliographe.studio on Threads</em></p>\n<p>Seven Pages icons from newest to oldest, each one more artistically interesting than the last. The original is exquisite. The current one is a squircle with a pen on it.</p>\n<p>This is even more cringe-inducing when you keep in mind something Gruber recalls from a product briefing with Jony Ive years ago:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apple didn't change things just for the sake of changing them. That Apple was insistent on only changing things if the change made things better. And that this was difficult, at times, because the urge to do something that looks new and different is strong, especially in tech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apple's hardware team still operates this way. An M5 MacBook Pro looks like an M1 MacBook Pro. An Apple Watch Series 11 is hard to distinguish from a Series 0. These designs don't change because they're excellent.</p>\n<p>The software team lost that discipline somewhere. Gruber again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know a lot of talented UI designers and a lot of insightful UI critics. All of them agree that MacOS's UI has gotten drastically worse over the last 10 years, in ways that seem so obviously worse that it boggles the mind how it happened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The icons are just the most visible symptom. The confidence to <em>not</em> change something\u2014to trust that the current design is still the best design\u2014requires knowing the difference between familiarity and complacency. Somewhere along the way, Apple's software designers stopped being able to tell.</p>\n\n            <p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/thoughts_and_observations_regarding_apple_creator_studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article \u2192</a></p>", "author": null, "expected": "filtered"}

My solution is to go in the opposite direction and interview founders directly, letting them give their subjective overview of their companies, while pressing them on their business model, background, and long-term potential.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s Interview is with Kalshi co-founder and CEO <a href=\"https://x.com/mansourtarek_\">Tarek Mansour</a>. Kalshi is a prediction market, where you can bet on future events happening. Kalshi came to prominence in the 2024 election where it hosted a huge amount of activity on the Presidential election outcome, and proved to be more accurate than polls. Kalshi\u2019s markets, however, go far beyond politics, covering everything from inflation data to sports outcomes. Kalshi itself is unique in that it is the only prediction market that has been approved for operations in the United States.</p>\n<p>In this interview we discuss Mansour\u2019s background in math and finance, and why the 2016 election helped convince him of the need for prediction markets. We talk about the Kalshi origin story, it\u2019s path to being regulated, and how the company almost died under the previous administration. We then talk about the challenge of building new markets, and the balance between retail investors and market-making ones. We also discuss how sports has come to dominate Kalshi\u2019s revenue, why Kalshi believes that new knowledge from insider trading isn\u2019t worth destroying people\u2019s sense of fairness about a new kind of financial company, and why prediction markets are essential for preserving market access to the general population.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, all Stratechery content, including interviews, is

Ben. I\u2019m very excited.</p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m very excited about this conversation as well, but before I start talking about Kalshi and prediction markets, I like to hear about people\u2019s background and you have a very interesting one, so I want to hear the Tarek\u2019s life story. Let\u2019s start with where you grew up, which was somewhere else in the world than where you are at right now.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I was born in California actually, in Bakersfield.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, interesting.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> My dad was studying for med school and then they didn\u2019t really love living in Bakersfield, so they moved back to Lebanon when I was pretty young, so they\u2019re both Lebanese, and I grew up in Lebanon. It was a very different upbringing, it was definitely not what you\u2019re used to or not a typical upbringing in the US.</p>\n<p>A few things shaped me, I would say a bit, but I\u2019ve always had a little bit of a obsessive brain, I have a bit of OCD and tend to be obsessed with things and so that was one part of it and that led me to first being very obsessed with math and getting into finance and later on downline get to Kalshi.</p>\n<p><strong>Even as a kid, was math your real obsession?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, I was always very, very into math. It was a bit of a refuge from everything else. When I was very, very young, I wasn\u2019t super social and I think my identity started revolving around math and being the best at math, and that was kind of my whole thing and I loved it. I really, really love math.</p>\n<p>The other kind of pillar is Lebanon is a very, you can call it a dynamic country. There\u2019s no default states, always changing, and the political environment is very, very rough, and then also had a few wars and a series of bombings, so there was kind of this constant state of instability that I think both of those things led me to like, \u201cOkay, I have to go back to the US\u201d, and my mom was also very much on board.</p>\n<p>I grew up with a single mom and it was kind of like, you have to go back to US because that\u2019s where you can make a future for yourself and do something. And I was obsessed with math, I was like, \u201cOkay, what is the best place to go?\u201d, and at the time I convinced myself this was MIT, so I spent five years figuring out how to get into MIT and I got there, which was exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>When you got to MIT, you were just going to study math? Did you know what you wanted to do?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, it was like, \u201cI like math, what are most of the smart math people doing?\u201d, and it was computer science, so I did computer science and math, I did both, and I loved it. I think MIT was sort of widening of aperture, I went from a place where not a lot of people cared really about math or anything really, to a place where I was kind of average, a lot of people were incredibly good in talent in what they were doing.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you handle that? How did you handle being average at math?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was pretty exciting, honestly. I kind of liked it because I\u2019m a very competitive person in general and so you meet people that, just their brain power was \u2014 it was really kind of elegant, it was beautiful to see and they could just think about things with the speed and with criticality of thinking that was just really impressive. So it pushed me to get better. As a very competitive person here, I want to get close and hang out with these people and try to learn from them and that has, I\u2019d say, accelerated my trajectory quite a bit. I think that MIT can really push somebody if you want to push yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Do they push you in a certain direction like, \u201cI need to find a specific area that I\u2019m particularly good at where it\u2019s as easy for me as pure math is for these folks\u201d, or was there a period of, \u201cI\u2019m going to overcome this, I\u2019m going to be amazing\u201d? I just remember, I thought I was good at math in high school and then I went to college and it became very clear that I was not that good relatively speaking to some people for whom it was effortless, and at MIT and you\u2019re studying math, it\u2019s like a whole other ballgame. You were definitely one of the people that would have showed me this isn\u2019t what it is, but I had a view in my head, \u201cMath was difficult, so it\u2019s super important\u201d, and I had to figure out actually things that are super easy for me is actually stuff that I\u2019m good at, that\u2019s why it\u2019s easy, and I need to lean into that. Was there an aspect of that process for you or you\u2019re just like, heads down, \u201cI\u2019m going to be awesome at math\u201d, and that\u2019s what it is?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was more the latter, it was more like, \u201cLet me just figure out how far I can get in kind of a variety of different directions\u201d. This is the beauty of it, you just get in and you get lost and there\u2019s different interests and people have all sorts of interests about a variety of different things, and you just wander around a little bit and try to do everything at once and then you have to pare back a little bit because it\u2019s too much.</p>\n<p>But no, it was more like, \u201cLet me see how far I can push myself\u201d, just for the sake of it. There wasn\u2019t sort of a specific end goal or intent it was more like, \u201cCan I do it?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s proving to yourself that you can do something. And it was some theoretical math, then it was some applied, there was some computer science, some algorithms, so there was kind of a large diversity of things, but then some patterns started emerging. I realized I really like things around probability and information theory, everything around how you can capture beliefs in a system or how can you move information from one place to the other and I realized that this is kind of an area and a region that I really like.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a specific precipitating event where you realized, \u201cOh, this is actually really powerful and interesting\u201d?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was a mix of things, but I did take a specific class actually, it was called Information Inference at MIT. What I loved is the professor, <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/gww/www/\">Greg [Wornell]</a>, would have a bunch of lectures and each lecture has a topic, and maybe model capacity is one topic, or inference is another, and then he would start the lecture with 15 minutes of history of what were the sort of early innings of usage of this concept and a lot of it was actually revolved around navigation, so how sailors would figure out where they were in the ocean via inference, and it was actually a lot of their modeling of where they were was actually probabilistic in nature. They weren\u2019t actually quite sure of where they were in the ocean, but it was fascinating, it was really cool, and the class was very hard, so it was also a big challenge.</p>\n<p>I think challenging things for competitive people, you tend to like them even more because they\u2019re interesting and they engage you and maybe as an aside, I\u2019m a strong believer of when you ask someone like, \u201cHey, what\u2019d you do this weekend?\u201d, or like, \u201cDid you have a great weekend?\u201d, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I had a really, really great weekend, I really enjoyed it\u201d. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, what did you do?\u201d, it\u2019s like, \u201cI went on a hike, it was exhausting\u201d, and there\u2019s like, \u201cOh, what did you do later?\u201d, \u201cI did X and my legs are hurting\u201d, and then you realize actually most activities that people think about enjoying are actually things that are sometimes painful, tiring, all of that, but it\u2019s all about being engaged with the activity, it\u2019s actually challenging you. So that was very much the case there, and then I think as someone who likes math and probability, start spending time in finance naturally.<a id=\"kalshi-origin\"></a></p>\n<h4>The Kalshi Origin Story</h4>\n<p><strong>I was going to ask you, when did the finance angle come in?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It\u2019s like, \u201cWhere are some of the smart people in math and what are the problems they\u2019re excited about?\u201d and, \u201cWhere can you do a lot of probability and this type of applied math?\u201d, and it is in finance. That\u2019s one of the really common applications, so I started spending time doing internships and all of that in finance.</p>\n<p>One of the places that I \u2014 well, I first started at Goldman and it was really interesting. First, I did structured credit, so high yield bonds, that was cool, then I did equity derivatives and specifically equity exotics, that was really cool. I really liked that because there the vast majority of demand in the desk was essentially this notion of, \u201cI\u2019m trying to price something that may happen in the world that may impact me\u201d, it was 2016, so there was two big, massive events. It <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum\">was Brexit</a> and then the election, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election\">the first Trump election</a> and this was sort of when the early innings of Kalshi starts forming because the vast majority of the demand was basically, I want to get exposure to Brexit or hedge against Brexit and I want to get exposure to Trump and hedge against Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>And, \u201cWhy could you just put a contract on it directly?\u201d</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was just so obvious, and I didn\u2019t even think about it immediately. It was first, \u201cOkay, how do we do it?\u201d, and then we would create bundles, so the specific trade that was a Trump trade that summer that we sold loads of was essentially you create a calendar spread, so it\u2019s two options, one that expires right before the election and one that expires right after, it\u2019s like the latest option that expires before the election and the earliest option that expires after and you go long one and short one so that you have an effective short on the S&amp;P, that was a Trump trade, \u201cThe S&amp;P will go down in that week if Trump wins\u201d \u2014 consensus, there was no question about that consensus, we didn\u2019t even get a question from the people buying it. It\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what if he wins and it goes up?\u201d, it wasn\u2019t even in question.</p>\n<p><strong>I can\u2019t remember, did it go up or did it go down?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It rallied really hard.</p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s what I thought, I was trying to remember. Actually, it\u2019s amazing how long ago that\u2019s been now. That\u2019s funny, you sold all these contracts and then they all went sideways.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It rallied incredibly hard. And so people are right about their prediction, but they lost money and so you had this, you kind of sit there and you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, this is a bad product, it\u2019s a really bad product for what the intended use case is\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>People went to your desk and said, \u201cI think Trump will win\u201d, and you sold them a financial product that actually punished them.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> And if you think about it, why would it be a great product? I mean, there is obviously, there\u2019s a huge basis for this, there\u2019s a huge delta that you\u2019re basically taking on here because really what you\u2019re trying to price is the reaction of the markets, traditional markets, bonds or equities or whatever to the event.</p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re introducing so many more variables to whether it comes through.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly. It\u2019s pretty much close to actually orthogonal, really, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s priced in and what\u2019s not, and it\u2019s really hard.</p>\n<p><strong>I think about it like a car backing up with a trailer.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>Sometimes you turn the wheel one way and it goes one way and sometimes it goes another, there\u2019s a few things going on there.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly, that\u2019s exactly it. You buy stock option before earnings because you think earnings are going to go well, you buy a call, then they go well, but actually it was already priced in that they were going to go well, so actually the stock goes down, and so it is actually orthogonal, it really is, it is a separate dimension that needs a separate instrument to get that exposure or hedge that exposure.</p>\n<p>And there are separate other things which is like, and the idea that it was traded over the counter, something that common and mainstream, like an election or Brexit happening, and Brexit impacted everybody, was being traded as a bilateral instrument. It\u2019s just you go to one party, which is the bank, and the bank prices it, and there\u2019s no other competitive dynamic or transparent bank to discover the price, to discover the thing itself, it\u2019s a little bit like the analogy, it\u2019s like how a lot of this stuff, a lot of financial market started. But imagine today if we were to worry about \u2014 if you want to buy Tesla or Apple stock, there\u2019s just one price here, it\u2019s just like one bank that says this is the price.</p>\n<p><strong>Well, it\u2019s like an IPO, right?</strong> <strong>The complaints people have with IPOs is you\u2019re trying to price versus a direct listing where the market discovery kicks in right away. If you\u2019re trying to price an IPO, usually it\u2019s always way too low as everyone will complain about in part because you\u2019re dealing with these other dynamics. You want demand, you want long-term investors, and you end up selling a bundle when people just want the one thing and the bundle kind of screws up the one thing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly, and I think also the bank needs to make a lot of money.</p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s conflict of interest.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Sort of, also the embedded spread, there\u2019s a big spread that is embedded into the instrument and today, just for a rough sense, on prediction markets right now, you have one cent spread on most things. It\u2019s like things trade 55, 56%, and you can buy 55, sell 56. At the banks, you would see things sometimes at 40% spreads. The bank, if you back imply whatever we\u2019re pricing this thing at, it was huge, so we were charging a lot.</p>\n<p>This was kind of the idea of you have a financial market to price companies, you have one for traditional commodities that started in the early 19th century with grain futures, and then it became commodity futures and metals. Then you got one for intangible commodities. I bucket it as interest rates, credit, currencies.</p>\n<p>What if the next generation of financial markets is you build one for pricing events of economic and or social importance? And that was really exciting because one, I think the TAM could be much larger because a larger number of people would care, people care about economics, they care about politics, weather, sports, and so on and that set is bigger than the percentage of people that care about how IBM is going to perform next quarter.</p>\n<p>Then the second thing is, if you believe in markets, I think what you really believe, and we can talk a little bit about this, but you\u2019re believing that there is a pretty good mechanism, an efficient mechanism to bring out information from a system, bring information out in the open and then aggregating it pretty well, it weighs beliefs pretty well. And in this case, you\u2019re bringing out information about questions about our future and so I got really excited about this idea and it started, I don\u2019t know if you ever read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\">[Friedrich] Hayek</a> back a hundred years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s what I was just going to ask about, you started at Kalshi in 2018, you\u2019re thinking about this in the mid 2010s, so the idea of a prediction market was not new, but what was it about that time period that was suddenly starting to make it seem viable, this is something that could actually be done?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> And I think it\u2019s worth here maybe just recapping the history real quick if you\u2019re up for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Please do.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> There\u2019s a few things that are relevant. First, there was Hayek who talked a bit about this kind of idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society\">knowledge problem</a>, which is basically a lot of the ways that we make decisions is in a centralized fashion, because that\u2019s normal, like a CEO and a board running a company or like a government running an entire country. But there\u2019s a problem, this kind of economic problem around resource allocation, which is that knowledge is often very dispersed, it\u2019s not actually centralized the way that we think it\u2019s centralized, it\u2019s in local places, sometimes really hard to find how are you going\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>And it\u2019s all in pieces too, right?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly.</p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s no central, all the knowledge is there. It\u2019s all the knowledge is dispersed across thousands of actors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly. It\u2019s actually kind of like four things. It\u2019s very localized, so dispersed locally. It\u2019s fragmented, so sometimes actually you have to have bend-</p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s the blind men feeling the elephant.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly, so you have to put the two pieces together from different places. Third, which makes it even more complicated, it\u2019s dynamic, it\u2019s not static in nature, so it\u2019s actually changing over time, so you have to have a mechanism to pull it consistently, continuously. And then last, sometimes it\u2019s kind of hidden, you may not even be able to know where it is, people may just not want to tell you that they have that information.</p>\n<p>And so Hayek starts thinking about this idea that knowledge is decentralized and the best way to aggregate it is prices, like prices of things, that\u2019s the closest aggregator of knowledge that we have today, and then it took basically, I think it was something like 40 years or 45 years after that for the first sort of prediction market to emerge, which is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Electronic_Markets\">Iowa Electronic Markets</a>. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of it.</p>\n<p><strong>I have not. No, I haven\u2019t.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Iowa University, very small, $100 per trader, few hundred traders, and they started with US elections and macro events. It was like a research university experiment and it was super non-liquid, very low capital, and it worked really well, it was overperforming the polls, so that was the first instance of a prediction market.</p>\n<p><strong>What time period is this?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> That was 1990s, 1985.</p>\n<p><strong>Okay.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> And it wasn\u2019t the exact phrase because before that there were people that would take odds on elections, and the New York Times used to report on the odds because they were more accurate than polls. That was before the Great Depression, so that worked really well. And then you had in the 2000s, a bunch of companies like Google, Microsoft, HP did some internal versions of prediction markets that worked quite well, \u201cHow well is the launch going to go?\u201d, and there there was a little bit of a weird thing there because there was a bit of a conflict of interest because the prediction markets may say things that leadership doesn\u2019t like to hear.</p>\n<p><strong>Right.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> So that\u2019s why they weren\u2019t very free in that nature, so that was a problem. And I think to me, it\u2019s like the biggest, I would say there was two big inflections.</p>\n<p>The one inflection in 2015 was [Philip] Tetlock and <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/\">the book Superforecasting</a> and I think what it gave us is basically it was a little bit of a framework and scientific framework around, \u201cLet\u2019s measure if these markets work and how they work\u201d and how judgment and belief get circulated in these systems. What he\u2019s found is at the end of the day, actually a group of intellectually curious people will outperform experts any given day if you put them in a room, and so they were like, that have triggered things <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)\">like Augur</a> and some crypto prediction markets to start.</p>\n<p>The second big thing I think was like, honestly, I think we were willing to take the four or five years to get it regulated to do it right.<a id=\"regulation\"></a></p>\n<h4>Prediction Market Regulation</h4>\n<p><strong>Well, so let\u2019s talk about this. So you start Kalshi in 2018, there are other folks starting around the same time, they go offshore. And as a US citizen, you\u2019re not supposed to bet on them. You guys decide, I think Coinbase is maybe a good analogy for your approach, which is we\u2019re going to jump through all the hoops, convince all the relevant folks so that we can operate in the US. Is that sort of a good summary of what you decide your approach is going to be?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah. I think we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to do this company, we\u2019re very excited\u201d, and by the way, that was 2016, we decided to start two-years-and-a-half years later, end of 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Yep.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> So one of my co-founders spent time at Bridgewater and we both spent time at Citadel and it was the same sort of thing that I just described, we\u2019d seen the same thing, they were like, \u201cI think there\u2019s clearly demand, it\u2019s also very useful if we could build this\u201d. Then yeah, what we defined in the early days were like, \u201cWhat is the thing that hasn\u2019t let these markets really thrive?\u201d \u2014 it was the lack of a proper regulatory framework, it was the lack of clear legality.</p>\n<p><strong>And why is that important?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. So I think, look, I would look at it from two perspectives, I think one is maybe pragmatic and one is a little bit more philosophical. The pragmatic version of this is essentially, I think in financial services and healthcare, regulation is uniquely important because when things go wrong, people get hurt in bad ways. Obviously it\u2019s your health, but also money. People really care about their money and their wealth and that they earned and they\u2019ve worked very hard to earn and if you do something wrong with that, it\u2019s pretty bad, and usually that kills a company. So this idea of, \u201cMove fast and break things\u201d, you could move fast, but try not to break things or really avoid breaking things at all costs because you\u2019re handling people\u2019s money or health and so there was a little bit of \u2014 I think we did not want to build a company that has a curse of scale, that the bigger it gets, the more risky it is. Actually having regulatory buy-in with decades of regulatory experience around us would help actually pressure test the company to make sure we can withstand the test of time, the test of large scale and so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>The philosophical one is more like, \u201cWhat do you want to build at the end of the day?\u201d, there\u2019s many ways to be successful and achieve scale and make money. We just weren\u2019t interested in building some sort of offshore semi-regulated, not regulated site. What we\u2019re really excited about is, could we make this a real financial asset? Could this be the next generation New York Stock Exchange? And that was really what we wanted to build. I don\u2019t think you can build that without real buy-in from regulators, real buy-in from mainstream brokers, institutions, like real legitimacy and so we\u2019re just much more excited about doing that. We were like, we\u2019re going to take however long it takes to make it regulated because we really care about this existing in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Was this clear to you that this would be a big differentiator for you as well? Has it proven to be a differentiator or was that you sort of got that by accident?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s interesting. In some ways for us, we made the decision independent of business success. So it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh, we think this is going to be the correct business strategy necessarily, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to do it\u201d, it was more like we just felt like taking this type of risk is unhealthy, it\u2019s not right, and I think not just for us personally, it\u2019s more like if you\u2019re building it and you\u2019re handling customers \u2014 at the end of day, we\u2019re 22 years old. We want to go talk to regulators and ask them what are the things that they\u2019re worried about and let\u2019s figure out how to resolve them and see how we can basically get it through.</p>\n<p>And then yes, it ended up being a huge differentiator because I think today, Kalshi is, I would say the more trusted one, we\u2019re more mainstream, you can access us without any weird VPN or anything like that. But it wasn\u2019t by design, it was more like we made the decision that we\u2019re going to be a regulatory-first company because we\u2019re in financial services.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a pushback from investors about this? \u201cThis regulatory path is too difficult\u201d, or was that actually an allure?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> We were so clear and dogmatic about that belief that I think I wouldn\u2019t know basically.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, you self-selected your investors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, we self-selected investors. And even if some of them may have felt like, \u201cHey, you should maybe stop\u201d, because they waited for four or five years, it\u2019s a long time.</p>\n<p><strong>Yep.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> So I\u2019m sure some of them thought, \u201cOkay, what are these guys doing? They\u2019re just waiting for this Hail Mary\u201d, but I think it\u2019s a little bit one of those things that you\u2019re not going to touch that subject with someone who\u2019s so dogmatic about it, so I don\u2019t think no one\u2019s brought it up is what I could say.</p>\n<p><strong>So you <a href=\"https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-designation\">get approval in November 2020</a>. Did you know that was coming for a while or was it suddenly like a bolt from the sky? What was the feeling when you finally are able to start operating?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was a really great feeling. We were waiting for it for two years and honestly, those two years were really difficult because it was truly 12, 14 hours a day of just regulation, no product building, nothing, just working, all the things around market integrity, customer protection, all this stuff that we need to lay down.</p>\n<p>It was amazing because we also got a bipartisan approval, it was a five-zero vote to legalize Kalshi. But what we didn\u2019t know is that \u2014 so we got the approval at the end of 2020, what we didn\u2019t know is that the last administration come 2021 was going to try to throttle prediction markets at all costs, a bit like what happened with crypto. Very similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. So because it was bipartisan, you sort of didn\u2019t expect that, you didn\u2019t see that coming?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> We didn\u2019t see that coming.</p>\n<p><strong>You needed a prediction market about how the administration was going to handle it!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was tough because we were finally, \u201cOkay, we can launch now\u201d, but then the way that these things go is that you can start, it\u2019s like a death by a thousand paper cuts. \u201cOh, you cannot launch because of this\u201d, and then it goes on and on and on forever basically, and so that was a very, very difficult period, very, very difficult because you thought you were across the finish line, but now actually everything is going to be unwound and undone and it was really difficult.</p>\n<p>Concretely what was happening is essentially if we were going to do this broad prediction markets about a variety of different things, now it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you can only list four markets and nothing else\u201d, and it\u2019s going to be about inflation next quarter, which is very useful and interesting and Fed interest rates, but that\u2019s not enough to build a platform and it really wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s also other products for Fed interest rates, for example, so we were in this very difficult position and that went on for years.</p>\n<p><strong>What did you perceive was the opposition? Was this just a fundamental mistrust of markets, like top down, \u201cWe get to decide what is bet on, what isn\u2019t?\u201d, where do you think this came from?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think the opposition was actually broader than just prediction markets, it was also to crypto, also to dream new \u2014 and even some traditional financial markets that were trying to do new things or introduce new things. And you see it, the novelty is not just coming from the prediction markets to the crypto companies, they\u2019re coming from NASDAQ, they\u2019re coming from CME. Those big legacy companies are also introducing a lot more novelty in the last year or so, so they were also facing similar things, but they had a prior business before that, whereas we didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Right.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> We were too small still where if you get stomped on and blocked, you just cannot really breathe, you cannot do anything. Whereas at a big company, you\u2019re still fine, you can water your plants and wait for next administration to raise new plans. But it was primarily, I think there was a blanket sort of, \u201cWe don\u2019t want innovation in financial services, financial services are mostly risks and they endanger people\u201d, and there was a little bit of a view that it\u2019s like retail. Trading in the stock market is gambling and it\u2019s a way to kind of rip off customers and so on and so forth and that view was predominant.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s like, why do anything new with that? It\u2019s already bad, it\u2019s a bad thing, so why even let it go beyond? If that\u2019s the view that you have about the stock market, imagine the view that you have about prediction markets. And look, to be clear, and what we always said, I think all financial markets have risks, it\u2019s like the idea to come and say, \u201cHey, let the innovation loose and free for all usually leads to bad outcomes\u201d, you need proper regulation, you need proper standards, you need proper frameworks around customer protections, and you need to figure out fair rules when people are participating.</p>\n<p><strong>But you also need a shred of appreciation for markets actually being useful.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, exactly, you also need to love markets, you need to believe that markets are actually a force for good, whether it\u2019s the stock market, which is about resource allocation and derivatives market which is about risk transfer and risk pricing and I think that lacked and I think the balance between the two is critical.</p>\n<p>I think as a company, I really feel like we tow that balance pretty well, we believe in both, we strongly believe in the power of markets, e also strongly believe in regulation and I think we put our money where our mouth is. We spent four years getting regulated upfront, but that was really the broad and then that gets to specific arguments, maybe there could be insider trading in these markets \u2014 well, there\u2019s insider trading in all markets, that\u2019s not a reason to carpet ban an entire market.</p>\n<p><strong>I think this is the broader point, is if you\u2019re dealing with people, it\u2019s hard to battle their reasons when the core motivation is they just don\u2019t see any inherent value in markets and if you\u2019re a market maker, it\u2019s a losing game. What are you going to do? There\u2019s going to be a million objections. But just to get to that market maker bit, you said something about, \u201cThey said there could be four markets\u201d, and you said that\u2019s not enough to build a platform.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah.<a id=\"creating-markets\"></a></p>\n<h4>Creating Markets</h4>\n<p><strong>Walk me through what is necessary to build a platform. Why do you need a lot of markets? What are the sort of factors that go into this, to your point to make something new from scratch, to not have something that\u2019s in addition to CME [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] or to the NASDAQ or whatever it might be? Just what are the dynamics of creating a market?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, I think that\u2019s a great question and maybe in a bit, we\u2019ll talk also about the election market that ended up helping us satisfy all the dynamics that were required to build the market.</p>\n<p>But I think financial markets, if we take a step back, they\u2019re a form of marketplace. You have a little bit of a supply and demand dynamic. Now, the supply and demand could be fungible in this case, someone who\u2019s supplying liquidity is acting as a \u201cmaker\u201d can also be a taker at times and vice versa. And in financial markets, the difficulty is that you also have a virtual cycle and the marketplace is working and you have a vicious cycle and the marketplace is not working, but I think it\u2019s a bit more pointed, it\u2019s a bit more difficult.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, if you\u2019re an Airbnb or DoorDash, you can line up some of the supply, pay them a little bit of extra time, and then as you build up the demand and then you can get the marketplace rolling. Here, it\u2019s really hard to pay either side enough to get them to stick for long enough till the whole thing works, you truly need them to come synchronously at the same time.**</p>\n<p><strong>Yep. It\u2019s the purest form of a two-sided market and you need both sides.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It\u2019s the purest form, it\u2019s the most extreme form. But on top of that, what makes it even more difficult in our business is that you have regulation. So you have national, like a lot of it, like bank level regulation, so you have a natural throttle.</p>\n<p><strong>Yep.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> You have to also get all of that and enough momentum to get the plane off the ground, but there\u2019s all these different weights and obstacles and it makes it really hard to maneuver the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Huge amount of motivation on the market participants to sort of overcome all those hurdles.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, huge amount of motivation to overcome all of that and you need kind of like a very long slog to get regulated first before you even start smelling product market fit or even have a shot at the product market fit, and so what you\u2019ve seen is that there hasn\u2019t been much competition. The derivatives industry was CME, which is really the Chicago Board of Trade and then CME and Chicago Trade got started in 1848, so it\u2019s a long time. And then you have ICE [Intercontinental Exchange], which has come from outside, they started in spot energy markets and then they came into derivatives, and that was started in 90s, but those are really the only two companies with meaningful scale. And anything else hasn\u2019t really gotten anywhere, basically. So you need a regulatory unlock and then you need a catalyst.</p>\n<p><strong>Right, and is this where the election came in for Kalshi?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think the election was, I think, enough of a catalyst to get this done because what we viewed is, first of all, election is one of the holy grails of prediction markets because it\u2019s so clear how it could be useful. Everybody cares about elections and people really care about who\u2019s going to win the election and who\u2019s going to win the election really impacts people in a variety of different ways. And now it\u2019s, I think, one of the biggest battles because we start working on the election market end of 2021, so working with policymakers, the regulators, then they banned us at the end of 2022, and we lost like I mean, a third of our team then. I think people kind of lost faith in this whole thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Lost faith, yeah.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s like, \u201cStrategy is wrong and why are you focused on this?\u201d, and all of that. And our response to that was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to try again this year\u201d, so we tried again in 2022 to 23, <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8780-23\">got banned again at the end of 23</a>. And I think that was, I would say the most crucible moment of the company where we <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/predictions-market-kalshi-sues-cftc-blocking-election-contracts-2023-11-01/\">decided to sue our own regulators</a>, so the the government, and we did that before it was actually cool or trendy to sue a regulator.</p>\n<p><strong>Right.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Now everybody is suing regulators and the SEC left and right, but at the time it was very, very hard. And remember, <a href=\"https://x.com/Alfred_Lin\">Alfred [Lin]</a> from Sequoia was on the board. Our board was supportive, but what they did say is in terms of patterns, this is definitely an anti-pattern. For a startup your size, suing your own government, that you generally die, the net result, you end up dying and there\u2019s all these ways that they can hurt you. But oftentimes these companies, the thing that actually makes the company succeed is an anti-pattern, it\u2019s something weird that ends up happening.</p>\n<p><strong>It makes me think of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2014/uber-fights/\">Uber</a>, they had to operate in the gray and get \u2014 that was an anti-pattern \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to systemically exploit regulation loopholes in city after city, get passengers on our side to force the politicians to cater to us\u201d. And to your point, in general, a bad idea, but sometimes it\u2019s the only idea that\u2019s going to pull it off, and a similar thing with suing the regulator, especially with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-allows-election-betting-dealing-blow-markets-regulator-2024-09-12/\">the lawsuit goes in your favor</a>, what, a month before the election? Is that when it came down?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, exactly, that also just sometimes things go your way. Right.</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s important \u2014 I mean, this is a little bit different from Uber because Uber could have a path, they could scale and you can create a narrative that there\u2019s going to be enough customers and then the laws were not clear. Ours actually, the laws were clear, we thought we were right on the law, but the government just did not abide by that.</p>\n<p><strong>Yep.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> We\u2019re like, one on my co-founders is extremely, extremely stubborn and kind of obsessed about election markets and she\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, the law applies to companies, individuals, but it also applies to government, so we\u2019re going to have to hold them accountable for this\u201d. So we sued and all the things that the board members were worried about happened, like death by a thousand paper cuts and they don\u2019t let you do this and this.</p>\n<p><strong>They\u2019re going to take revenge on you in every way that they can.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Everything you can possibly imagine starts happening. And you\u2019re always thinking, is this because of the lawsuit or is this just because you never know, but it probably correlated.</p>\n<p>But it happened, we really got the lift on being able to election on October 7th and that was, I think you have enough of demand, you have enough motivation in the customer, both the customers and the makers, liquidity providers to come around this market even in a short period of time and we had a few weeks to push it extremely hard to take prediction markets mainstream and that few weeks was like, it worked. It changed, I think that was the catalyst, the chain reaction started going.</p>\n<p><strong>How much volume came in those four weeks in the election market?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It was like a billion-and-a-half to two billion.</p>\n<p><strong>And was that more than all the volume you\u2019d had to date previously?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Way, way more. We were doing $20 to $30 million a month before that. So it was just like 100x overnight, 50-to-100x overnight.</p>\n<p><strong>And so they all come in for the election and then does it turn out then a lot of that ends up staying around?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, because now people are educated, they know what it is, they want to explore other things, the liquidity is also now started to percolate to other things and now there\u2019s some math for us to work with. You can start optimizing the system, push liquidity in certain places, you have a reaction now. It\u2019s not fully going parabolic, but you have something to play and you can add matches here and there and keep the reaction going. But that\u2019s very different from death \u2014 stagnant, nothing happening, you bring someone in, they don\u2019t find liquidity, you bring a liquidity provider, they don\u2019t find customers, nothing is happening. So that was really kind of the initial thing.</p>\n<p>But there was one thing that was really interesting, maybe one comment before we move forward, one learning \u2014 and Kalshi is an interesting business because we in took a lot of variance across time and when the variance went to the other side, so when in 2022 and 2023 we lost, the perception of leadership was like, \u201cOh, we did the wrong thing, execution was bad, strategy was bad, et cetera\u201d, and when it went the right way, you kind of go from that to being an incredible operator.</p>\n<p><strong>And you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m doing the same thing all along\u201d.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> You\u2019re doing the same thing. And it\u2019s funny because I give it always like the World Cup when the French team won the World Cup. Then four years later, they went to the last World Cup, which is 2022, and usually it\u2019s been very consistent when the winner of the World Cup usually doesn\u2019t make it past the playoffs every time.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, they don\u2019t even make out a pool play.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> And the French team actually makes it to the final, not only do they make it to the final, they make it to penalties and they lose on penalties, which is literally a coin flip.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iaE0xHfUro\">One of the greatest games of all time</a>, it was amazing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> The next day they call for the sacking of the coach. And sometimes this is kind of business, but I think the ability to take those risks is underappreciated because it enables you to play in environments that most people try to shy away from.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. Well, tell me about this, what is more important in a prediction market \u2014 you keep bringing up words like liquidity and market makers, things along those lines \u2014 what\u2019s more important? Is it the retail investor, the volume, the number of traders, or is it folks that are putting in large amounts of money, not because they actually have a stake in the outcome, they\u2019re trying to make an edge? You mentioned you were at Citadel, for example, probably the all time great example. Citadel doesn\u2019t care what side of the bet it\u2019s on, as long as it\u2019s first to the bet and can make it on both sides, and they\u2019re going to make fractions of a penny on every single trade, and they make money no matter what, it\u2019s an amazing business. How does that balance work out in prediction markets and what\u2019s the harder part of it to solve?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s chicken-and-the-egg, typical chicken-and-the-egg. So when a market has a lot of demand and there\u2019s any other benchmarks of standards to price, the demand, the consumer side is more important, being able to attract consumers to the market because liquidity is a little bit easier.</p>\n<p>But the more you go into the fringes, the harder the liquidity because there\u2019s not like, \u201cWill TikTok get banned?\u201d, what are you going to base off your pricing, your initial pricing off of? It\u2019s much harder to price that. You have to be much more independent in your thinking and the more you go into these types of markets, the more liquidity is actually the bottleneck and the more you have to figure out how to bring in enough information from diverse participants to basically price something.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk me through the mechanics here. \u201cIs TikTok going to be banned?\u201d, who creates that market? Who sets the parameters? Is that also a thing that Kalshi does or do people do it? How do the nuts and bolts of this work?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, everything is centralized. So yeah, first market idea, it could be our team that is monitoring what\u2019s trending, what\u2019s top of people\u2019s minds, what do people care about, and then list the market on that, or it could be user suggestions. Some users come and say, \u201cHey, we want to see this or that market\u201d, and we put it in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>Then I think there\u2019s a bunch of regulatory stuff, make sure it\u2019s not a market that could have perverse incentives. War, assassination, violence, those are things that are illegal for regulated exchange and we don\u2019t do and we can talk a little about that, the distinction regulated and unregulated in a sec, but we\u2019re regulated, so we cannot do any of these things. And then you have to have a clear set of rules and that\u2019s hard because the rules need to be very precise.</p>\n<p>The interesting thing though, it\u2019s always been an issue in financial markets. The rules are always an issue. And I\u2019ll give you two examples. Do you remember the scene in the Big Short where Michael Burry gets a credit default swap from Goldman, and then for a while Goldman was like, \u201cOh, the conditions are not met\u201d, even though they were clearly met, so that\u2019s one example of hard rules and financial markets, where there was a bit of a conflict of interest, so that was a different issue.</p>\n<p>Two is when CME brought in butter futures, market participants started fighting each other and it was like, \u201cNo, this should count because milk is butter\u201d, and then so what CME\u2019s solution was like, \u201cOkay, honestly, we don\u2019t really care what butter is, but here\u2019s the contract specs, they\u2019re called event contracts because they\u2019re a legal contract that says butter is going to be this level of saturation, this level of salt, whatever\u201d, and so in this case, we have to have certainty, a legal contract that says, \u201cHere\u2019s how we\u2019re going to settle this if the word goes in different ways\u201d, and that\u2019s a hard problem. You have to really think through all the potential edge cases and get smarter over time.</p>\n<p>The beauty is now we have done so many of those that everything is kind of a template from something we\u2019ve done in the past, and we\u2019ve learned a lot from prior instances of those markets. And then after that, okay, you list the market and now you have to bring in the liquidity, and that\u2019s kind of the key piece. The way to think about this is all of our markets go through direct listing, there\u2019s no IPO process or anything like that. It\u2019s actually, you just let it there, and generally what happens is that market participants in small size, they start battling a little bit, they start jousting, you see this curve in small size, like they\u2019re testing the waters, \u201cWhat does the market feel like this is?\u201d, and there\u2019s a little bit of negotiation via trading amongst all the market participants, and then it stabilizes. Then you feel like, \u201cOkay, the market sort of oriented here\u201d, and then once it stabilizes, liquidity starts going up over time because now people feel like, \u201cOkay, it seems like this is where the market is\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>The variance is very bad for the market makers because they could just sort of get caught out. So once you have this small fry price discovery, it\u2019s stable, then it\u2019s safer to come in because it\u2019s going to move, you might move a cent or two.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Market makers like noise. So they like the small because they\u2019re making money on spread, but they don\u2019t like the sort of drastic shoots because that means that maybe they have\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>They might have the wrong sign, yeah.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, they missed some information, some news broke out that somebody is kind of capitalizing on and so that\u2019s an interesting dynamic. That also matters for specific markets because election, what\u2019s good about it is you know that you\u2019re not going to get that all the way up until 5:00 PM after the polls close, so you can be safe in providing for a while until that. But in a market like will some news drop this year? That could drop any time of the day. So those are much harder to basically make for and for liquidity markets this tends to be a lot more of the bottleneck.</p>\n<p><strong>So how do you get liquidity into those markets? And where does <a href=\"https://news.kalshi.com/p/liquid-prediction-markets-are-finally-here\">that partnership with Susquehanna International Group</a>, that was also in 2024, how important was that? Obviously being approved for the election market was the most important thing, but how important has it been to you to bring in institutional money as sort of a liquidity provider?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It\u2019s very important because I would say two things. Again, the chicken-and-the-egg, it\u2019s like if Airbnb really wants to start building demand in a certain market, maybe buying or renting a few houses in bulk to get started is a good idea to show that there\u2019s demand then get more hosts to start hosting and it\u2019s a little bit the same here. It\u2019s like you\u2019re kind of getting a hotel maybe, but you\u2019re getting a big market maker to provide liquidity a bunch of markets and liquidity begets liquidity. The dynamic that we just described, when you have more liquidity, it\u2019s safer for you to come in and put liquidity. So if you come and see, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a few other people here with a few tens of thousands already at the top of the book that is providing\u201d, it\u2019s easy for me to put another thousand on each side because I\u2019m not the only one pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re not causing it to skew all over the place just by coming in.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly. If you have an analysis that tells you it\u2019s 55% and you\u2019re going at it alone, you may not be certain, but if a bunch of other people also believe it\u2019s 55% and they\u2019re providing liquidity, you feel a bit better. And so having a first and then a second and third, it makes it easier to get the N+1 at every time, and so it\u2019s very important.</p>\n<p>So they helped us start equating, for example, the politics, the economics, some of the sports, some of the culture and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have some of these providers because they are a bit the match that starts or the first domino that helps others basically feel confident in providing liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>But do they come into these super obscure markets where it\u2019s hard to get liquidity? Or is that where you have issues of Kalshi needs to come in itself as a market maker, but then you get people feeling like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m betting against the house, this isn\u2019t fair\u201d, or whatever it might be.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s important to understand: Kalshi, the exchange itself never trades by law, by regulation we cannot. So there\u2019s a separate company that\u2019s an affiliate independently run that provides equity on the exchange, and that\u2019s common structure with traditional stock market, traditional derivatives market, but they are treated literally like any other customer. So they have the same rights, same obligations, they don\u2019t have access to any information that is sort of different than what a traditional customer would have access to, and this is why it helps.</p>\n<p>And by the way, and I\u2019ve said this publicly, it\u2019s not profitable, so that\u2019s not a place that makes money in the business and the reason they exist is exactly those markets. Sometimes if others don\u2019t want to get started in some of those markets, but customers still want to trade and, \u201cWill TikTok get banned?\u201d, they could be the initial liquidity that helps others get started. ]</p>\n<p>Really it\u2019s a cost center. They\u2019re a place, they\u2019re a way to incentivize a bit like when Uber wins incentivizing new city or suburbs. Like yes, people need Uber in the suburbs, it\u2019s not just in the middle of Manhattan and people need Uber and sometimes you need to provide it a bit of an incentive for people to go a little bit out of their way to get density there. And then after that, it could become organic as it scales and there\u2019s more customers.</p>\n<p><strong>So just from an accounting perspective, would you say it\u2019s a cost center? Is this above the line or below the line? Is this like a marketing expense almost?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> We think of it as like, yeah basically a marketing expense. I forgot or COGS, but basically it\u2019s something that you put in like, okay, there\u2019s markets that we make a lot of money or by that, I mean the market makers have enough of a pie to make money. And by the way, just to be clear, sports or election is some of our biggest markets.<a id=\"sports\"></a></p>\n<h4>Sports</h4>\n<p><strong>Well, that\u2019s what I was going to ask. There\u2019s all these highfalutin ideals about prediction markets and how useful they are and instead of having to buy these baskets of goods or options or whatever, you could just bet on the event directly. However, does it turn out that people just want to bet on sports?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I mean, I think yes, a lot of people want to trade on sports, there is no question about that and we could talk about sports in a second a little bit more in depth, but there\u2019s a lot of demand on the other things that just fluctuates in ebbs and flows.</p>\n<p>I think back in 2024, 95% of our volume was in elections, on politics, because that was the most prescient, I think as we go into 2026, you\u2019re going to see a lot around the midterms and it\u2019s going to be like \u2014 I think politics is going to be a huge chunk. So you just need to have things that are topical. Our financials and crypto markets are also really big, so it\u2019s not just that.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a question actually, and I don\u2019t think even question of demand, it\u2019s a question of liquidity and recurrency. If you compare one market to one market, a lot of markets that are non-sports actually have as much value, but especially if you compare apples to apples, but there\u2019s not enough of them. It\u2019s a matter of us scaling our operations, being able to get those markets listed and then get enough liquidity on them, which is more difficult and so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.</p>\n<p>I think yes, I\u2019m a believer in free markets. I\u2019m a believer that, for example, for sports, this model is much better, there\u2019s no house, you can be a price maker, you don\u2019t have to be a price taker. There\u2019s no house where the house always wins. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s game to basically trade against anybody and you\u2019ve seen in the numbers, a much higher percentage of people basically win here. And it\u2019s more social, more intrinsically interesting, it moves faster.</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a bit too where just there\u2019s a lot of sports games every day again and again. So these are sort of short-lived markets on an individual basis versus, \u201cX news is going to happen before Y\u201d, or even in an election, that\u2019s a one-time thing that\u2019s years in the future?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think that\u2019s a big part of it. I think that at the end of the day, there\u2019s just a higher frequency of markets. That\u2019s why people see this more per unit of time, more volume, per market, that\u2019s not necessarily the case and that\u2019s important in terms of what we\u2019re talking about in terms of the demand.</p>\n<p>I think the way to think about it is the pricing benefits, they don\u2019t necessarily need to be uniform across all the sort of different markets. Some markets have pricing benefits to some people and some markets have pricing benefits to other people and it doesn\u2019t need to be this thing where one market fits everybody all at once. But no, I think for us, applying a prediction market model for sports, just feels significantly superior than what\u2019s traditionally the kind of business model. It seems it\u2019s healthier, there\u2019s less conflict of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>Not like <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2025/12/18/the-battle-to-stop-clever-people-betting\">screening out the sharps</a> because they\u2019re costing you too much money.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, definitely. I mean, you can win as much as you can if you\u2019re great, and there isn\u2019t this incentive to make customers lose because we don\u2019t make money out of somebody losing.</p>\n<p><strong>Right. You make money on your business models, you make money on transaction fees. Is there a bit where this high volume gives you a lot of transaction fees? I think it\u2019s something like 80 some percent of your revenue is coming from these sports bets, but that is actually what\u2019s enabling all the other parts that you\u2019re more interested in, so it\u2019s sort of working out on both sides.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> That tends to be true for a lot of businesses, that you have one piece that helps bootstrap or grow the other pieces. And you can see with Amazon, you can see that. I mean, a lot of companies and consumer companies, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s working really well, and that one thing helps other things basically start working really well and in this case, for example, as you want to incentivize liquidity in some of the markets and questions that we really want answers to, those incentives comes from other places that are generating fees and other things.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of the incentive, the beauty here is where we incentivize is basically make it as clear as possible for customers what they\u2019re trading and make them engage and make them essentially happy with the product, which I think is a healthier incentive long term than like, \u201cHey, I make more revenue if you lose more to me\u201d, which I think is a more adverse incentive.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you deal though with your coming in sideways and, \u201cWhy do they get to be in all these sports markets, this sort of thing that\u2019s been banned for a long time?\u201d \u2014 how is this not gambling and why isn\u2019t it regulated as gambling?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think there\u2019s two things. I think one position, an important position to take is what is the underlying that you\u2019re trading on and is there positive externalities?</p>\n<p>People always have this idea of gambling. Okay, but let\u2019s define gambling. What does that mean? Gambling, you could think of gambling as the thing, which is the gambling industry. You go to casinos and the business model is like revenue equals to customer\u2019s losses and you\u2019re rolling a dice and you\u2019re trading on it and then there\u2019s the verb which is like, \u201cI\u2019m putting some money to make money on something that I don\u2019t control\u201d, that\u2019s actually a very widely understood definition of gambling. That definition applies to buying stock. It does, very narrowly in a very narrow sense. And in that action, actually, that action that we\u2019re talking about, the speculative action, I think that sometimes when people use gambling it\u2019s speculation, applies to a lot of activity that we see in the stock market. Whether it\u2019s retail, individuals, also businesses and institutions.</p>\n<p>So to me, it\u2019s like the differentiator, if you want to take a principled line, is one, is there an underlying outcome that is actually useful where there\u2019s positive externalities? In this case, whether some people can hedge on the thing, or they get informed by the price, or both, and that\u2019s very different from trading on Brexit, or trading on the outcome of a game, which impacts a lot of people, a lot of people care about. It\u2019s different from rolling a dice to speculate on it, which is an artificial risk that\u2019s created versus a natural risk that exists.</p>\n<p>And the second thing is the structure and the mechanics, which is very important. To me, gambling, why I think at the core, you cannot really call it stock market, even retail trading and stock market gambling, it\u2019s because gambling is an industry that is basically, you go into a house, the house always win, their revenue\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Structured for the house to win.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> It\u2019s structured for the house to win, it\u2019s structured for the house\u2019s revenue to equal to its customers\u2019 losses. So obviously the incentive is to promote more losses from the customers, because that\u2019s how you make money. Whereas this is not the case. This is the peer-to-peer, people are trading against each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Your structure is to increase volume.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Exactly. Increase engagement and it\u2019s very, very different, and I think it\u2019s a much healthier mechanism, it\u2019s a much healthier mode of engagement. And it looks and feels, and it is much closer to what you see in traditional financial markets, where price discovery is open and transparent.<a id=\"fees-insider-trading\"></a></p>\n<h4>Fees and Insider Trading</h4>\n<p><strong>Do you feel tension though that by having transaction, by pricing on a per-transaction basis, you\u2019re actually also a retardant on volume in the market, because more trades are going to cost people more money and this would be better if people could trade more freely?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> You mean the balance of fees?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think you have to balance it out, because if for example, we take the fees to zero, then we can not incentivize and provide liquidity in a bunch of places, and actually the volumes may actually go to zero.</p>\n<p><strong>So is that a super important lever for you, particularly with these institutional investors in terms of changing your free structure?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Not just institutional, individuals, even more importantly. As you want to incentivize individuals to come in. And by the way, just to be clear, on sports and elections, the vast majority of our liquidity is individuals, it\u2019s not these institutional people that you think. There\u2019s a chunk from institutionals and a much bigger chunk from people that are individuals, that are peer-to-peer, people are trading against each other.</p>\n<p>But I think that the more important thing is bringing more customers and more participation and more price discovery into these markets. And yes, fees generally, it\u2019s always true, they add a little bit of friction to a marketplace, and that\u2019s always true. But practically, when you take out fees, you cannot really operate the company, obviously.</p>\n<p><strong>All ways of making money in a purely liquid market are going to produce friction. Your estimation is that this particular one comes with the least bad trade-off, so that\u2019s the one to do.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> If it\u2019s structured the right way, and you have to have the right balance of fees, and you have to make sure that you have the right balance of incentives. And it\u2019s a delicate balancing act, I would say but it\u2019s a little bit like same question as Uber, could they have more transactions if they took out their fees? Probably not, honestly, because they wouldn\u2019t be able to invest in R&amp;D and make their product better and provide incentives for drivers, and probably total net sum of transactions would go down over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. You said earlier this month that you <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/07/kalshi-inside-trading-tarek-mansour\">endorsed a prediction market ban on insider trading</a>, because you already ban insider trading. Isn\u2019t that counter to the whole idea that the idea of prediction markets is to surface information? Isn\u2019t a lot of that disparate information that\u2019s out there buried inside companies, or inside government, and shouldn\u2019t we want insider trading, because then we get an early view of what\u2019s going to happen?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> That\u2019s a great question, and I\u2019m glad you asked. So first a principle, so I think it\u2019s important, and I think this gets lost a little bit in the conversation, that like any nascent industries there\u2019s regulated and unregulated players and companies \u2014 and I made a post about this recently, which was a little bit of joke, but for every Robinhood.com, you have buy stocks on some offshore with crypto dotcom company.</p>\n<p><strong>And this is where your competitors come in terms of the ones that are offshore.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> And there are some competitors that unfortunately fall in that category. But it\u2019s not even about a competition thing, it\u2019s as we think about the impact on society and policymakers, I think it\u2019s important to differentiate there are companies like us, and we\u2019re not the only ones. There\u2019s Robinhood, there\u2019s Crypto.com, there\u2019s Coinbase, they\u2019re regulated. We have a bunch of laws that we abide by and we abide by US law and US regulations, the CFTC \u2014 the CFTC oversees us, and we have a number of things that we have to do by law.</p>\n<p>So let\u2019s just define the things that need to be done by law. We have to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer\">KYC [Know Your Customer]</a>, we have to know who our customers are, get their social security, their name, their address, like a financial broker. We have to do due diligence on them, make sure there\u2019s the source of funds for money laundering checks and sanctions and all of that and we have to run a comprehensive surveillance program, which is a bit like the New York Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p>So think about the rules against insider trading and market inflation that you see in the New York Stock Exchange, ours are mimicked the same way, same rules, because we have to and we have the same enforcement mechanism, so you flag weird suspicious patterns. Usually when people commit fraud, they do weird things. You flag that, it goes to investigation, then you catch them and if we catch them doing inside trading, that\u2019s a financial crime, that is illegal, that\u2019s not allowed.</p>\n<p>Now, there\u2019s a question you\u2019re asking that\u2019s a bit more philosophical, or at a policy level, which is this the right thing?</p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the point of prediction market? Is it the ultimate positive externality that we are surfacing knowledge that would not surface otherwise?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> So that\u2019s the point of any market, any market does price discovery. Any financial market, at least to some extent, does price discoveries. It\u2019s done on stocks, it\u2019s done on interest rates, it\u2019s done on credit, it\u2019s done on currencies, and it\u2019s done in our case on events, on the future, on the future forecasts.</p>\n<p>But insider trading is banned in all of these markets, right? It\u2019s banned in the stock market. And the reason and the principle line to take, I think there\u2019s two reasons. One, and the way that we define it is you cannot trade on material non-public information, which means that you cannot trade on information that is not supposed to be public. If you work at the BLS, and there is rules in the BLS on the underlying, the national work, that you\u2019re not supposed to release that information, trading it is a way to release it.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, so there\u2019s already a law in place, you\u2019re already violating it by insider trading.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> You\u2019re violating the thing.</p>\n<p>The second reason is fairness, there\u2019s that reason for a stock market. The second reason trading is banned in the stock market is that if it\u2019s not, then you won\u2019t have a lot of liquidity. No one will feel safe being out there when somebody could come with illegally obtained, or information they have obtained that\u2019s unobtainable for others to trade against them, they will be adversely selected and be hurt by that.</p>\n<p>And so no, we are very much so the traditional market structure and traditional structure, because you don\u2019t need to use that information to get enough price discovery. I think you can get a lot of price discovery without actually releasing the answer to something that you shouldn\u2019t be releasing. And so, there\u2019s a delicate balance like with all things, because you could argue that people should be trading on earnings ahead of earnings, but then how could we have a safe, fair stock market for anybody to find?</p>\n<p><strong>Do you feel like as a startup, as a relatively new market maker, which do you feel more strongly? Do you feel the incentive to, \u201cWe want our prediction markets to be consistently ahead of the curve, so people realize this is super useful?\u201d, or do you feel that counterbalance, which is, \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to feel like it\u2019s unfair and so we need to protect market participants\u201d, even if it reduces the quality of the overall takeaways that people can get from our product.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think the second one is very important, and I don\u2019t think it takes away that much from prices currently. And the reason is because in a world where you\u2019re letting insider trading and these things happen, which again, they\u2019re not legal, these are not allowed, like current regs don\u2019t allow for it. One, you could basically mess up with the underlying, like people now can release BLS data ahead of time, which is not a good thing. That\u2019s just now messing up with a real \u2014 and you can extrapolate that to a variety of different examples. And then two, people will stop participating, because they believe that it\u2019s not fair. And then I think if people stop participating over time, you\u2019re not going to get a lot of the price discovery that you want to get.<a id=\"social-value\"></a></p>\n<h4>Social Value</h4>\n<p><strong>This is my last question, but do you ever step back and think about you have product market fit, and there can be very narrow things. Obviously, you go back to the initial example of the Trump bet in 2016, and how you should be able to bet on that directly. You were able to bet on that directly in 2024 and to widely written about, widely discussed, you talked about it, major company. There\u2019s also this broader philosophical debate about a lot of young people in particular feeling somewhat left out of the economy, or feeling that the upside isn\u2019t what they were promised, that if they put in hard work and do the nine-to-five, that they\u2019ll be a millionaire by the time they retire. And so, now there\u2019s like a, \u201cWhatever, might as well speculate\u201d, is there an aspect, is there something to that? That\u2019s part of your product market fit? A certain sort of disillusionment and malaise in the world generally, or is that above your pay grade?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I\u2019ll give you some of my thoughts on that. I go back, similar to some of the questions that we had before. Look, I\u2019ll say two things. Financial markets come with risk, and yes, there\u2019s speculation at any type of financial markets. That argument that you just made could be made about options, could be made about crypto, could be made about really any mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Right. This isn\u2019t a prediction market point.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah. But the important thing, and that\u2019s going to go back to the regulatory piece, it can be managed appropriately. If you have the right safeguards and you actually put measures around customer protections, and you have federal government and regulators on top of you, the bad incentives in the system get drastically mitigated. So I think doing this on places where there is real customer protection and good incentives embedded into the system is much better than places, I\u2019m assuming we all agree that offshore, which usually is where vast majority of this stuff goes, where sometimes you lose your money, you don\u2019t even know where your money goes, or even in places where the incentives are messed up and they\u2019re screwed. They actually want to promote more of that, I would say, dangerous type of behavior.</p>\n<p>The second thing I think, and it\u2019s honestly part of why we started Kalshi and it got me really excited is, if a lot of that energy is going to the stock market, not specifically stock market, options market and Wall Street, I call them the kind of Wall Street markets, I think there\u2019s a little bit of a feeling generally that overall the game is rigged against people.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, the house is back.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Yeah, right. A little bit, right? You feel that if you\u2019re trading on stocks or options or some of the traditional stuff, how could you have more information than the large market makers, the large Wall Street banks and institutions, that are seeing everything way more than you do? They have 10x more, 100x more access to information than you do and there\u2019s a little bit of elegance and beauty in Kalshi. We see it across the board. People that start this as a hobby and they do it full time and they read the news a lot, they care about the economy, they care about politics, they care about sometimes esoteric things like the weather and they study that every day, and it\u2019s a bit of their home turf.</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah. You\u2019re reducing the variables in a bet to just one variable, because the more variables there are, the bigger advantages the house has.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I\u2019m reducing the imbalance, there\u2019s a level playing field aspect to prediction market, which is like \u2014 and I give this example, I think I told you about this last time, the best inflation forecaster on Kalshi is not one of the hedge funded institutions or sophisticated Wall Street guys, it\u2019s a guy that lives in Kansas, never really traded the stock market, loves reading the news, very avid news reader and has just spent a lot of time thinking about how the economy progresses. And it\u2019s pretty cool and pretty awesome this person can make a little bit of money on this passion and hobby of theirs and then also bring useful information to the markets for us to get informed. <a href=\"https://kalshi.com/category/economics/inflation\">Our inflation forecast</a> is the most accurate on the planet, so pretty much most of our forecasts are more accurate than any of the alternatives. But I think there\u2019s just, in my opinion, it\u2019s a much healthier place to be in than a place where the game is rigged against you.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you ever worry though, that as you get larger and the importance of having institutional money and to provide liquidity, all these sorts of things, will you lose that? Will you lose the sense that the little guy\u2019s on the same playing field as the big guy? Or is it the simplicity of the market, either something happens or it doesn\u2019t, give you confidence you can avoid becoming the house?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> I think simplicity and the fact that there\u2019s a real fair value, like Brexit will happen or not. Whereas the stock market, it\u2019s not just about, \u201cWhat is the fair value of Apple?\u201d, it\u2019s, \u201cWhere are the mutual funds buying and who\u2019s buying where?\u201d and you have to have access to a much broader set of information to figure out the right price and that broader set of information is oftentimes inaccessible to the individual, to the person that may not. Whereas here, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s buying what, either Brexit will happen or not, there\u2019s a real intrinsic fair value. And if you\u2019re smart about politics and you read a lot and you\u2019re really interested in that, you can basically figure that out, independently of where people are buying.</p>\n<p><strong>And this is good for society?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TM:</strong> Definitely, I think this idea of getting smarter about a lot of these different topics and events is \u2014 and people could argue, are we getting insanely significantly stronger, smarter, or 20, 30% smarter? I would say even in 20, 30% case, it\u2019s very, very important, very useful, because we can make decisions a little bit better, we can allocate resources a little bit better, and we can manage risks a little bit better. And that\u2019s, I think, a very useful thing to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Tarek Mansour, it\u2019s great to talk to you.

You document the rules\u2014colors, typography, spacing, logo usage\u2014and hope people follow them. They don't, or they follow the letter while missing the spirit. Every designer who's inherited a brand system knows the drift: assets that are technically on-brand but feel wrong, or interpretations that stretch \"flexibility\" past recognition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?2140\">Luke Wroblewski</a> is pointing at something different:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Design projects used to end when \"final\" assets were sent over to a client. If more assets were needed, the client would work with the same designer again or use brand guidelines to guide the work of others. But with today's AI software development tools, there's a third option: custom tools that create assets on demand, with brand guidelines encoded directly in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key word is <em>encoded</em>. Not documented. Not explained in a PDF that someone skims once. Built into software that enforces the rules automatically.</p>\n<p>Wroblewski again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So instead of handing over static assets and static guidelines, designers can deliver custom software. Tools that let clients create their own on-brand assets whenever they need them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is a super interesting way of looking at it.</p>\n<p>He built a proof of concept\u2014the <a href=\"https://lukew.com/maker/\">LukeW Character Maker</a>\u2014where an LLM rewrites user requests to align with brand style before the image model generates anything. The guidelines aren't a reference document; they're guardrails in the code.</p>\n<p>This isn't purely theoretical. When Pentagram designed Performance.gov in 2024, they delivered a library of 1,500 AI-generated icons that any federal agency could use going forward.

Iterating a <code>Span</code> in the inner loop is a lot\ncloser to the \u201cideal\u201d model of advancing a pointer over a buffer and accessing\nthe elements directly.

But then, I would: I spent over a decade working to build open source communities, and then another decade and change working alongside and then inside newsrooms.</p><p>So it\u2019s to my chagrin that the newsroom where I currently serve as Senior Director of Technology is one of the places listed here where open source contributions have significantly dropped off:</p><blockquote>\u201cAt ProPublica, teams published detailed white papers alongside major investigations, explaining their quantitative methodologies with scientific rigor, allowing other researchers to verify and learn from their work. Major news organizations ran active blogs where they shared techniques and lessons learned. Conference presentations at NICAR and elsewhere became venues for passing along hard-won knowledge.\u201d</blockquote><p>The effect of this work didn\u2019t just lift the work of journalism, it attracted new people to it:</p><blockquote>\u201cThis culture made newsrooms more attractive places to work for civic-minded technologists. If you had programming skills and wanted to use them to make a difference, journalism offered you the chance to build things that mattered and share them with the world.\u201d</blockquote><p>I think there\u2019s a lot to be gained by collaborating on an open source basis. We typically run small, resource-constrained teams where building new software is contextually hard. And we have problems that, if they\u2019re not identical, are at least significantly overlapping; by <em>not</em> collaborating on them, we further an ecosystem where low-resource organizations are all solving the same sorts of things with very few people and very little money in parallel.</p><p>I was present at the News Product Alliance Summit session described in this piece, and I think the analysis of both the causes of this decline and some of the solutions are spot on. I was particularly enamored by the idea of an Open Source Editor (or director \u2014 does everything in news need to be an editor?) and public recognition for great open technical work in the field of journalism.</p><p>I think it\u2019s also worth saying that open source, done well, is about much more than just releasing your code. A good open source project is a community, not a package. So there\u2019s a lot of ecosystem development and community management involved to foster the kind of real collaboration that is required for this to succeed \u2014 even after newsrooms have overcome the institutional hurdles to releasing their work in the first place.</p><p>I\u2019m really grateful that Scott and Ben have been championing this cause. I\u2019m right there with them, and I\u2019ll do what I can to help.

It was joined by Kimi K2 Thinking <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/kimi-k2-thinking/\">in November</a> which added reasoning capabilities. Now they've made it multi-modal: the K2 models were text-only, but the new 2.5 can handle image inputs as well:<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kimi K2.5 builds on Kimi K2 with continued pretraining over approximately 15T mixed visual and text tokens. Built as a native multimodal model, K2.5 delivers state-of-the-art coding and vision capabilities and a self-directed agent swarm paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"self-directed agent swarm paradigm\" claim there means improved long-sequence tool calling and training on how to break down tasks for multiple agents to work on at once:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For complex tasks, Kimi K2.5 can self-direct an agent swarm with up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to 1,500 tool calls. Compared with a single-agent setup, this reduces execution time by up to 4.5x. The agent swarm is automatically created and orchestrated by Kimi K2.5 without any predefined subagents or workflow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I used the <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5\">OpenRouter Chat UI</a> to have it \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\", and it did <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/32a85e337fbc6ee935d10d89726c0476\">quite well</a>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Cartoon illustration of a white pelican with a large orange beak and yellow throat pouch riding a green bicycle with yellow feet on the pedals, set against a light blue sky with soft bokeh circles and a green grassy hill.

The feet do not quite align with the pedals, which are floating clear of the frame.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/kimi-k2.5-pelican.png\"></p>\n<p>As a more interesting test, I decided to exercise the claims around multi-agent planning with this prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to build a Datasette plugin that offers a UI to upload files to an S3 bucket and stores information about them in a SQLite table. Break this down into ten tasks suitable for execution by parallel coding agents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/ee2583b2eb5706400a4737f56d57c456\">the full response</a>. It produced ten realistic tasks and reasoned through the dependencies between them. For comparison here's the same prompt <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/df9258e7-97ba-4362-83da-76d31d96196f\">against Claude Opus 4.5</a> and <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/6978d48c-3f20-8006-9c77-81161f899104\">against GPT-5.2 Thinking</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5\">Hugging Face repository</a> is 595GB.

First-quarter projections for revenue and earnings both fell well short of Wall Street estimates. And a conference call with analysts, where Tan said it would take \u201ctime and resolve\u201d to turn around the company, sent the shares down further. Production snags have hampered the comeback bid, a disappointment for investors who anticipated more of a boost from new products. \u201cWe are on the multiyear journey,\u201d the CEO said.</p>\n<p>Intel, the largest maker of personal computer processors, is suffering from low manufacturing yields \u2014 the percentage of usable chips coming out of its factories. That\u2019s made it harder to fill orders. The once-dominant semiconductor company has spent years trying to restore its technological edge and recover from market share losses, and this is one more setback. Demand is \u201cquite strong,\u201d and the company is working hard to fix its manufacturing problems, Tan said in an interview. But Intel used up much of its inventory in the fourth quarter, he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/tsmc-risk/\">yesterday\u2019s Article</a>, which was in many respects a rewrite of <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2026/tsmc-earnings-the-tsmc-brake-revisited-why-ai-needs-foundry-competition/\">last week\u2019s Update on TSMC earnings</a>, to publicly urge chip buyers to start thinking seriously about 2029: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have enough chips, and the best way to get more chips will be to be the customer Intel (and Samsung) needs to move to the leading edge and provide competition for TSMC, spurring them to increase investment. Intel\u2019s earnings, however, were a painful reminder of why Intel\u2019s biggest problem isn\u2019t customers, but rather itself.</p>\n<h3>The Agentic Opportunity</h3>\n<p>For the first few years of the AI boom the primary use case was training (and training is still the primary use case for leading edge AI chips in particular). AI training fleets do use CPUs: they are what coordinate and feed GPUs. Nvidia\u2019s Grace Blackwell architecture, for example, has one CPU for every two GPUs; it\u2019s previous Grace Hopper architecture shipped in a one to one configuration. These Grace CPUs were ARM-based, but they could, in theory, be x86 based (which <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/nvidia-and-intel-tans-earnings-call-negotiation-deal-specifics/\">Nvidia and Intel are working on</a>); the more important point is that GPUs still need CPUs.</p>\n<p>Still, training is very focused on GPUs and keeping them full of data; memory is more likely to be the bottleneck than the CPU. Inference, on the other hand, is more CPU dependent: you have to schedule a job, get the relevant data for the job, and only then feed it to the GPU, which ideally is never sitting idle (it\u2019s expensive!). It follows, then, that more inference relative to training means more demand for CPUs.</p>\n<p>Still, the real bottleneck for basic inference is whoever is asking the question, and humans \u2014&nbsp;even the fastest ones \u2014 are slow. Agents, on the other hand, are fast, and thorough. If you have an agentic workflow, which invokes tools, multiple data lookups, etc., you have a workflow that looks a lot like some inference workflows. The difference, however, is that the AI is dramatically faster than the human, which means all of those tool invocations, data lookups, etc. happen far more quickly and frequently than they ever would with a human. Critically, all of those agentic workflows \u2014 above and beyond basic inference \u2014 are better done by a CPU. In other words, to truly make AI autonomous, you don\u2019t just need GPUs, but also CPUs.</p>\n<p>This reality \u2014 first the shift to inference, and then the build-out of agentic capabilities \u2014 has led to soaring demand for traditional server CPUs over the last six months or so. Moreover, this demand has been exacerbated by the fact that a lot of data center CPUs came from the huge buildout that happened to support remote work during COVID: those five year-old CPUs just aren\u2019t fast enough, which means that agentic workflows require new CPUs on both sides \u2014 the agent side, and the data delivery side.</p>\n<p>This is the driver of the huge demand that Intel has seen this quarter and last quarter, and augurs well for the company\u2019s prospects. After all, not only does Intel make x86 server chips, but they also control their own fabs, which means they get to internalize all of the upside of these greenfield sales. The problem, however, is that they can\u2019t actually make all of the sales.</p>\n<h3>Intel\u2019s Mistaken Pessimism</h3>\n<p>The reason Intel is failing to capture this opportunity is not, contra Bloomberg, because of disappointing yields on their latest process node, or their lack of an external customer. Instead, the answer is a familiar one: Intel shot themselves in the foot. From the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-problems-trump-bump-17d2c941\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When President Trump promised Intel nearly $9 billion and gave it his vote of confidence as an America-first tech company, it looked like the start of a new era. Investors assumed new orders would flow to the troubled chip maker and bid up the stock 120% in just five months.</p>\n<p>And customer demand for Intel\u2019s products did explode \u2014 but Intel wasn\u2019t ready for it. After months of cutting capacity on its older production lines, the company was unprepared for a surge of orders for processors to put in AI data centers. Intel\u2019s stock has crashed 17%, wiping out more than $46 billion in market value, since executives revealed the flub on the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over the past year, Intel has retired expensive tools used to make its older generations of data center CPUs, including those from its Emerald Rapids and Granite Rapids series. But over the course of the second half of 2025, companies such as OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Google began to realize that deploying generative AI models required more and better CPUs, which act as the central computing brain of most servers, than they had initially thought. Suddenly, Intel was fielding requests to buy thousands of older CPUs. But because it had taken so much manufacturing capacity offline, the company was unable to meet that demand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Emerald Rapids was built on Intel 7 (10nm), and Granite Rapids on Intel 3 (7nm), and Intel doesn\u2019t want to rebuild the capacity they tore down. The company did reallocate as much remaining capacity as it could to server parts, but the company\u2019s monolithic designs (as opposed to AMD\u2019s more flexible chiplet approach) means that takes a long time to bear fruit. The end result is that Intel didn\u2019t make as much money as they could have last quarter, and they\u2019re going to make far less than they might have this coming quarter.</p>\n<p>This is where the yield story comes in: Intel is, in the long run, hoping to make up the difference by getting 18A up to speed (18A parts launched last quarter, but for client); that, however, rightly makes prospective foundry customers nervous. One of the most important promises a foundry can make is to have capacity: if Intel doesn\u2019t even have enough capacity for its own market opportunity, can it be trusted to have foundry capacity for external customers?</p>\n<p>Of course this is a moot point for now; Intel still doesn\u2019t have any meaningful external customers (thus my Article yesterday), and the target for external customers is 14A. Even then, however, Intel is not yet spending the money to build that capacity; CFO David Zinsner said on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4862077-intel-corporation-intc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">the earnings call</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On 14A, Lip-Bu has been very direct with us on all of this. He does not want to spend on capacity on 14A, only spend on the kind of TD spend or R&amp;D spend associated with 14A even in the fab until we have customers secured. We\u2019ve talked about, the likelihood is, our customers on 14A their window to secure or for us to secure them will be in the back half of this year and in the first half of next year. And so once visibility improves there, we\u2019ll start to unlock the spend on 14A.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s fair to argue that <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/intels-new-ceo-reevaluating-gelsinger-lip-bu-tan-and-cadence/\">previous CEO Pat Gelsinger was too optimistic</a>; it\u2019s ironic, however, that Intel\u2019s problem today is that new CEO Lip-Bu Tan ended up being too pessimistic when he decided to start tearing down those established nodes. And, when it comes to meeting the industry\u2019s 2029 needs, I\u2019m not sure this cautious approach is the right one. Intel doesn\u2019t just need customers; they could, in the end, use a little bit of that Gelsinger optimism. After all, risk isn\u2019t just about downside: it can also be about missing out on the upside, which is exactly what happened to Intel.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This Update will be available as a podcast later today.

One of my favourite things is starting to learn an\nOld Boring Technology that I\u2019ve never tried before but that has been around for\n20+ years. It feels really good when every problem I\u2019m ever going to have has\nbeen solved already 1000 times and I can just get stuff done easily.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thought it would be cool to learn a popular web framework like\nRails or Django or Laravel for a long time, but I\u2019d never really managed to\nmake it happen. But I started learning Django to make a website a few months\nback, I\u2019ve been liking it so far, and here are a few quick notes!</p>\n<h3 id=\"less-magic-than-rails\">less magic than Rails</h3>\n<p>I spent some time <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/09/day-1--a-little-rails-/\">trying to learn Rails</a> in 2020,\nand while it was cool and I really wanted to like Rails (the Ruby community is great!),\nI found that if I left my Rails project alone for months, when I came\nback to it it was hard for me to remember how to get anything done because\n(for example) if it says <code>resources :topics</code> in your <code>routes.rb</code>, on its own\nthat doesn\u2019t tell you where the <code>topics</code> routes are configured, you need to\nremember or look up the convention.</p>\n<p>Being able to abandon a project for months or years and then come back to it is\nreally important to me (that\u2019s how all my projects work!), and Django feels easier\nto me because things are more explicit.</p>\n<p>In my small Django project it feels like I just have 5 main files (other\nthan the settings files): <code>urls.py</code>, <code>models.py</code>, <code>views.py</code>, <code>admin.py</code>, and\n<code>tests.py</code>, and if I want to know where something else is (like an HTML template)\nis then it\u2019s usually explicitly referenced from one of those files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-built-in-admin\">a built-in admin</h3>\n<p>For this project I wanted to have an admin interface to manually edit or view\nsome of the data in the database. Django has a really nice built-in admin\ninterface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.</p>\n<p>For example, here\u2019s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields\nto display in the \u201clist\u201d view,  which field to search on, and how to order them\nby default.</p>\n<pre><code>@admin.register(Zine)\nclass ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = [\"name\", \"publication_date\", \"free\", \"slug\", \"image_preview\"]\n    search_fields = [\"name\", \"slug\"]\n    readonly_fields = [\"image_preview\"]\n    ordering = [\"-publication_date\"]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm\">it\u2019s fun to have an ORM</h3>\n<p>In the past my attitude has been \u201cORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been enjoying Django\u2019s ORM so far though, and I think it\u2019s cool how Django\nuses <code>__</code> to represent a <code>JOIN</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Zine.objects\n    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query involves 5 tables: <code>zines</code>, <code>zine_products</code>, <code>products</code>, <code>order_products</code>, and <code>orders</code>.\nTo make this work I just had to tell Django that there\u2019s a <code>ManyToManyField</code>\nrelating \u201corders\u201d and \u201cproducts\u201d, and another <code>ManyToManyField</code> relating\n\u201czines\u201d, and \u201cproducts\u201d, so that it knows how to connect <code>zines</code>, <code>orders</code>, <code>products</code>.</p>\n<p>I definitely <em>could</em> write that query, but writing <code>product__order__email_hash</code> is\na lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would\ntake me a little while to figure out how to construct the query\n(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).</p>\n<p>I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I\u2019m\npretty excited about ORMs for now, though I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find things to be\nfrustrated with eventually.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-migrations\">automatic migrations!</h3>\n<p>The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!</p>\n<p>If I add, delete, or change a field in <code>models.py</code>, Django will automatically\ngenerate a migration script like <code>migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py</code>.</p>\n<p>I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I\u2019ve just\nbeen running the generated scripts with no change and it\u2019s been going great. It\nreally feels like magic.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right\nnow because I\u2019m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want\nit to work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-like-the-docs\">I like the docs</h3>\n<p>I had a bad habit of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMw1QTP2no\">never reading the documentation</a>\nbut I\u2019ve been really enjoying the parts of Django\u2019s docs that I\u2019ve read so far.\nThis isn\u2019t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a\n<a href=\"https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--writing-great-documentation.html\">talk from PyCon 2011</a>\non Django\u2019s documentation culture.</p>\n<p>For example the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/db/models/\">intro to models</a>\nlists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-sqlite\">using sqlite</h3>\n<p>After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to\nunderstand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with\nSQLite instead. It\u2019s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by\njust doing a <code>VACUUM INTO</code> and then copying the resulting single file.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been following <a href=\"https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production\">these instructions</a>\nfor using SQLite with Django in production.</p>\n<p>I think it should be fine because I\u2019m expecting the site to have a few hundred\nwrites per day at most, much less than <a href=\"https://messwithdns.net/\">Mess with DNS</a>\nwhich has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are\nsplit across 3 different SQLite databases).</p>\n<h3 id=\"built-in-email-and-more\">built in email (and more)</h3>\n<p>Django seems to be very \u201cbatteries-included\u201d, which I love \u2013 if I want CSRF\nprotection, or a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, or I want to send email, it\u2019s all\nin there!</p>\n<p>For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so\nthat it didn\u2019t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit\nof configuration.</p>\n<p>I just put this <code>settings/dev.py</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = \"django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend\"\nEMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / \"emails\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then set up the production email like this in <code>settings/production.py</code></p>\n<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = \"django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend\"\nEMAIL_HOST = \"smtp.whatever.com\"\nEMAIL_PORT = 587\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = True\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = \"xxxx\"\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')\n</code></pre>\n<p>That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there\u2019s\nlikely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot\">the settings file still feels like a lot</h3>\n<p>I\u2019m still a bit intimidated by the <code>settings.py</code> file: Django\u2019s settings system\nworks by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit\nstressed about\u2026 what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?\nHow will I know? What if I type <code>WSGI_APPLICATOIN = \"config.wsgi.application\"</code>\ninstead of <code>WSGI_APPLICATION</code>?</p>\n<p>I guess I\u2019ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I\u2019ve\nmade a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can\u2019t rely on the\nlanguage server support.</p>\n<h3 id=\"that-s-all-for-now\">that\u2019s all for now!</h3>\n<p>I haven\u2019t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before\n(right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static\nsites), so I\u2019m interested in seeing how it goes!</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven\u2019t really gotten into\nDjango\u2019s form validation tooling or authentication systems.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.</p>\n<p>(we\u2019re still experimenting with the comments-on-Mastodon system! <a href=\"https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115969229107460589\">Here are the comments on Mastodon</a>! tell me your favourite Django feature!)</p>", "author": null, "expected": "python"}
