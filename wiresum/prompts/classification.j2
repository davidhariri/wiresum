interest: match to key or null
is_signal: true ONLY if actionable or insightful. Filter out:
- Marketing, PR, corporate case studies
- Creator spotlights, "how X uses Y" fluff
- Personal posts, off-topic content
- Podcast/video promotions
- Generic news without insight

reasoning: 2-3 bullet points with key insights/takeaways. What did I learn? Why does it matter? Be specific, not generic.

GOOD reasoning (takeaways I can use):
- "• Regulatory moat took 4 years—competitors locked out\n• Election drove 50x volume spike overnight"
- "• BorrowingSequence cuts ARC overhead for noncopyable types\n• Applicable to tight loops in data processing"

BAD reasoning (just summaries, no takeaway):
- "AI tool release with new features"
- "Startup interview about market opportunity"

Interests:
{% for interest in interests %}
- {{ interest.key }}: {{ interest.label }}{% if interest.description %} - {{ interest.description }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
